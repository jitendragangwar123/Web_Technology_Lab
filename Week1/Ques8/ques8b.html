 <h1><u>Paragraph-1</u></h1>
 <p id="para1">
    A smart home or automated home could be based on a platform or hubs that control smart devices and appliances.
    For instance, using Apple's HomeKit, manufacturers can have their home products and accessories controlled by an application in iOS devices such as the iPhone 
    and the Apple Watch.[27][28] This could be a dedicated app or iOS native applications such as Siri.
    This can be demonstrated in the case of Lenovo's Smart Home Essentials, which is a line of smart home devices that are controlled 
    through Apple's Home app or Siri without the need for a Wi-Fi bridge.[29] There are also dedicated smart home hubs that are offered as standalone platforms to
    connect different smart home products and these include the Amazon Echo, Google Home, Apple's HomePod, and Samsung's SmartThings Hub.
    In addition to the commercial systems, there are many non-proprietary, open source ecosystems; including Home Assistant, OpenHAB and Domoticz

 <h1><u>Paragraph-2</u></h1>
 <p id="para2">
    The main concept of a network of smart devices was discussed as early as 1982, 
    with a modified Coca-Cola vending machine at Carnegie Mellon University becoming the 
    first Internet-connected appliance,[6] able to report its inventory and whether newly 
    loaded drinks were cold or not.[7] Mark Weiser's 1991 paper on ubiquitous computing, 
    "The Computer of the 21st Century", as well as academic venues such as UbiComp and 
    PerCom produced the contemporary vision of the IOT.[8][9] In 1994, Reza Raji described the
     concept in IEEE Spectrum as "[moving] small packets of data to a large set of nodes, so as 
     to integrate and automate everything from home appliances to entire factories".[10] Between 1993 and 1997, 
     several companies proposed solutions like Microsoft's at Work or Novell's NEST. The field gained momentum when Bill Joy 
     envisioned device-to-device communication as a part of his "Six Webs" framework, presented at the World Economic Forum at Davos in 1999.
