			One of the defining works of the Harlem Renaissance, by its greatest poet. It also, of course, 
			gave inspiration and lent a title to another literary classic: Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun.

			To be quite honest, my favorite Plath poem is “The Applicant.”

			The most famous poem, and a terribly beautiful one, by our country’s first African-American Poet
			 Laureate (though the position was then called Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress).
			 See also: “Those Winter Sundays, which despite what I wrote above may be equally as famous.”
