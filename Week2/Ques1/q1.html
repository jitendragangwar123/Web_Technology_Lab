                        <p>Java is an object-oriented, class-based, concurrent, secured and general-purpose computer-programming language. 
                            It is a widely used robust technology.Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.

                            Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a
                             registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the Oak name to Java.

                             System.out.println("Hello Java");

                        <p>The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for
                             the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to 
                             develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc.
                             However, it was suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.</p>

                        <p>The primary objective of Java programming language creation was to make it portable, 
                            simple and secure programming language. Apart from this, there are also some excellent features which play an important role in the popularity of this language. The features of
                             Java are also known as java buzzwords.</p>

                           <p> A list of most important features of Java language is given below.</p>

                    <p>In this page, we will learn about the basics of OOPs. Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts, 
                        such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism, etc.

                        Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language. The programming paradigm where everything
                         is represented as an object is known as a truly object-oriented programming language.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a
                             methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. 
                            It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts:
                        </p>
                        <li>Object</li>
                        <li>Class</li>
                        <li>Inheritance</li>
                        <li>Polymorphism</li>
                        <li>Abstraction</li>
                        <li>Encapsulation</li>
                        <p>
                            Apart from these concepts, there are some other terms which are used in Object-Oriented design:
                        </p>
                        <li>Coupling</li>
                    <li>Cohesion</li>

                 <p><b>What is an object in Java</b></p>
                 <p>An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc. It can be physical or logical 
                     (tangible and intangible). The example of an intangible object is the banking system.</p>
                 <p><b>An object has three characteristics:-</b></p>
                 <li>
                    State: represents the data (value) of an object.</li>
                    <li>Behavior: represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.</li>
                    <li>Identity: An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID. The value of the ID is not visible to the external user. 
                        However, it is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely.</li>
                    <p><b>What is a class in Java</b></p>
                    <p>A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. 
                        It is a logical entity. It can't be physical.</p>
                        <p><b>Method in Java</b></p>
                        <p>In Java, a method is like a function which is used to expose the behavior of an object.</p>
                        <p><b>/Example:-</b></p>
                        <code>
                            //Java Program to illustrate how to define a class and fields

                    <article>
                        <p>Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).

                            The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover,
                             you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.</p>

                     <p><b>Method Overriding in Java</b></p>
                     <p>If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java.

                        In other words, If a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared by one of its parent class,
                         it is known as method overriding.</p>

                        <p>A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java. 
                            It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).
                           Before learning the Java abstract class, let's understand the abstraction in Java first.</p>

                              <p>An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.

                                The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body.
                                 It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
                                
                                In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method body.

                            Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.encapsulation in java
                            We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private. Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.
                            The Java Bean class is the example of a fully encapsulated class.</p>
